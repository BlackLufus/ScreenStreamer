# Screen Capture Utility Documentation

## Project Motivation
This project was developed as a hands-on learning experience to deepen my understanding of several key aspects of C++ programming and software development:

1. Practical C++ Mastery
    - Implementing real-world functionality using modern C++
    - Working with Windows APIs and third-party libraries
    - Memory management and resource handling
2. Project Structure & Organization
    - Creating a logical class structure
    - Separating interface from implementation
    - Managing dependencies
3. Development Workflow
    - Incremental feature implementation
    - Debugging and optimization
    - Version control integration
4. Technical Exploration
    - Image processing fundamentals
    - Cross-format conversions
    - Performance considerations

The screen capture functionality serves as an excellent case study because it combines:
- Low-level system API calls (Windows GDI)
- Memory manipulation
- File I/O operations
- Third-party library integration

## Current Implementation Overview
This utility captures screen content and saves it as PNG images using Windows GDI and STB Image Write. It supports both 24-bit (RGB) and 32-bit (RGBA) output formats.

## The utility currently provides:
- Screen capture using Windows GDI
- Flexible output formats (24-bit or 32-bit PNG)
- Memory-efficient conversion
- Error handling for unsupported formats

## This implementation serves as a foundation for further exploration of:
- More advanced capture methods (DXGI)
- Additional image formats
- Performance optimization techniques
- Cross-platform compatibility
